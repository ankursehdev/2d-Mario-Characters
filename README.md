# 2d-Mario-Characters with JS and CSS3

Mario 2D Characters using JS, HTML5 & CSS3.

The idea behind this is to create a GRID using 2D javascript arrays. 

I found this implementaion [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/fun-times-css-pixel-art/) and PEN BY Una Kravets [code-pen](https://codepen.io/una/pen/oXXRgg) using SCSS and thought of implementing this using Javascript. The concept is similar but I am using the 2D array to read the pixel-map color to make the element.

## What it looks like?

## Next

1. I will be writing a reactJS application to handle all the colors dynamically.
